The key frames always come with the vendor prefixes: -webkit, -moz, -ms, -o

Transformations
The first value in the CSS3 transformational functions is for the X-axis; the second is for the Y-axis. If only one value is defined, it will be applied to both axes.

Challenge 1
Make an image double in size when you hover over it but donâ€™t make it jump. Use a transition to make the transformation smooth. The transition should happen within 1 second, and the transition-timing-function should be set to ease-in. In the hint tab, you'll find a link to boilerplate files to help get you started.

Challenge 2
Use the rotate function to spin an image infinitely. The image should rotate without any breaks and stops. Don't forget to give your animation a name! In the hint tab, you'll find a link to boilerplate files to help get you started.

challenge 3
When hovered, move a div with a class of element on X axis by 100% in 1 second. Apply transitions.
